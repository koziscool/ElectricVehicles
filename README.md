The role of electric cars is a profoundly significant part of our future, with important consequences in transportation, energy, consumer economics, the environment, logistics, infrastructure, and many others beyond that.  Accordingly there is tremendous interest in understanding, controlling, or adapting to the role of electric cars, not least by the car manufacurers themselves.

In today's consumer market, the conventional wisdom is that car buyers are very enthusiastic about the prospect of purchasing electric cars.  However, there are a few factors limiting the penetration of electric vehicles as a percentage of the total vehicles on the road today.

1. Limited availability from car manufacturers.
2. Higher price than otherwise similar gas or diesel powered vehicles.
3. Poor infrastructure to support electrice vehicle ownership, in particular lack of charging stations.
4. Poor range before refueling compared to similar gas or diesel vehicles.

In the bigger picture, you could say that 1 and 2 above are very closely related, and 4 is a special case of 3.  In any event, for the purposes of this project, we boil these alternatives down to two: is the decision to purchase an electric vehicle primarily about money, or ease of use?

To that end, we consider the prevalence of eletric car ownership in Oregon, as recorded by current DMV registrations, in light of personal demographic data, primarily economic data such as annual income.  Alternatively, we also consider the electric vehicle registration in light of the nearby charging stations available to service them.  The overall intention is to assess, with at least some credibility, that between economic considerations or ease of use, which is the most important factor in the trajectory of the role of electric vehicles.

The role of electric cars is a profoundly significant part of our future, with important consequences in transportation, energy, consumer economics, the environment, logistics, infrastructure, and many others beyond that. Accordingly there is tremendous interest in understanding, controlling, or adapting to the role of electric cars, not least by the car manufacurers themselves.

It is the intent of this project to develop further insight into the trajectory of market penetration for electric vehicles.  Specifically, for the would-be consumer, is the decision to purchase an electric vehicle primarily about money, or ease of use?

To that end, we consider the prevalence of eletric car ownership in Oregon, as recorded by current DMV registrations, in light of personal demographic data, primarily economic data such as median annual income. Alternatively, we also consider the electric vehicle registrations in light of the nearby charging stations available to service them. The overall intention is to assess, with at least some credibility, that between them which is the most important factor in the proliferation of electric vehicles.
